# Introduction to Reinforcement Learning @ ASAI, 2023 Bertinoro, Italy
This repository contains the code for the course "Reinforcement Learning, Unlocking the Power of AI Agents".
The course aims to provide a practical introduction to reinforcement learning, 
a subfield of machine learning that is concerned with learning how to make decisions in complex environments. 
The course is designed to be accessible to students with a basic knowledge of Python and machine learning. 

The course is divided into three parts: the first part introduces the basic concepts of reinforcement learning, 
the second part introduces the most common algorithms (Q-Learning, Deep Q Learning, Reinforce), 
and the third part is this practical hands-on about the common libraries (PyTorch and Gymnasium).
